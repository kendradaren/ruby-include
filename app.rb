# As the EncryptionUtility class is "extended" by EncryptionSHA,
# the methods of EncryptionSHA # are added as class methods to
# EncryptionUtility, so this works:
p EncryptionUtility.encrypt("Hello Kendra")

# However, the following cannot work

p enc.encrypt("Hello Kendra")

# you have to use
p enc.class.encrypt("Hello Kendra")

# this does not work
p person.encrypt("Hello Kendra")

# extend Encryption in just the person instance
person.extend(EncryptionSHA)
p person.encrypt("Hello Kendra")

# fails as person doesn't have a password

# this does not work as we only extended the person instance
